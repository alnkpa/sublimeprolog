# Prolog syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 2 #

This package provides syntax highlighting and automated build for the logic
programming language Prolog. It is highly work in progress, so use with care.

## Auto Build System ##
To be able to use the `Ctrl+B` automatic build, you need to define `main/0`
where you compute the solution and you also print it. For example:

    main :- compute(input, Solution), writef('%t\n', [Solution]).
    
An indicator that this is not done (correctly) is the following error:

    ERROR: call/2: Undefined procedure: main/1
    ERROR:   However, there are definitions for:
    ERROR:         main/0

## Installation ##

### Installation via Sublime Package Control ###

I recommend using the [Sublime Package Control] [1] to install this package. 
This way is much more convenient. It is named *Prolog syntax highlighting* 
there, as well.
